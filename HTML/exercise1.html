    <h1>A Hot Summer Day</h1>
    <h2>Hot is a gift</h2>
    
    <p>A hot summer is more a punishment than a gift. The unbearable heat
        makes us uncomfortable and lethargic.
    </p>

    <p>The period between dawn and sunrise is a lovely sight. The twilight
        scene is most appealing. The calm and serene atmosphere, the cool
        and bracing climate and the refreshing breeze so othe our spirits.
        The sweet chirping sound of birds appears to be the most enchanting.
    </p>

    <h2>Afternoon is the hottest</h2>

    <p>The afternoon is the hottest. The piercing rays of the sun fall on the
        ground. The heat is unbearable and oppressive during the afternoon.
